# Skincare Generator - General Assembly - Final Project

*Welcome to the Skincare Generator! You are one click away from curating your ultimate skincare cabinet. 
*
I created this app as a fun and easy way to randomly generate industry awarded skincare products. This app pulls skincare products from Sephora using an API and conveniently adds them to the viewing user’s “cabinet” so that they can see the products that will become a part of their everyday routine.
## Quick Start

######Steps to Generate Products: 
1. Select the ‘Generate Products!’ button 
2. View the randomly generated product displayed
3. If the product is of interest for you, select ‘Add to Cabinet’
4. If the product isn’t of interest to you select ‘Generate Products!” for a new product to display
5. Repeat this process until you have built your ultimate skincare routine

######Steps to Empty a Cabinet:
1. If your cabinet doesn’t seem to align with your skincare goals, select ‘Empty Cabinet’ to remove all of the products currently added to it.

######Steps to View More Details about Products:
1. If you like the product you have generated but are interested in viewing more details about it, select the ‘View Product Details’ button. This will open a new tab where you can view additional details about the product provided by the Sephora website.

## Status

Active: This project is one of the first ones in my portfolio and I’m planning to continue building it out.
Upcoming Features:
1.	Display loading modal while generated product image is updating
2.	Additional styling to enhance look/feel of webpage
3.	Ability to remove one item from cabinet vs the entire cabinet
4.	Ability to calculate total cost of cabinet 
5.	Incorporation of additional APIs from other beauty retailers (Amazon, Ulta, L’Oreal)
6.	Ability to input a skincare concern as a parameter and have products generate based on the concern
