# Kelly Stickell - General Assembly - Final Project

Completed a class assignment to develop my own Javascript version of the card game "War".
- Completeness Score: 4/5 (Although this is more complete than my other version, I figure there are still some things I missed)
- Comfortableness Score: 4/5 (Having to spend so much time on this helped me to learn the concepts more)

## Quick Start

- Steps to Run Script: 
In your console, type in node script.js and hit enter

- A message for each "round" of the game showing: 1) who won the round, 2) the cards played by each
    player, and 3) how many cards each player now has will be returned.
- A final "winning player" message will display once the game is over (i.e., one player has 0 cards or not enough cards to play)
- An error message will display if anything goes wrong

If script does not run, please notify kelly.stickell@gmail.com
